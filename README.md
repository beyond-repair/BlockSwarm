Roadmap: BlockSwarm Intelligence Prototype Framework
1. Smart Contracts Development
:Objective: Develop and deploy essential smart contracts on Avalanche Testnet using Truffle Suite and OpenZeppelin templates.
 -Tasks:Set up Truffle project and configure for Avalanche Testnet.Develop Token Contract for governance using OpenZeppelin templates.Implement a simplified DAO Contract with member management and basic voting mechanisms.Consider additional contracts like Agent Registry and Task Management (if needed).Deploy contracts on Avalanche Testnet for initial testing.
2. AI Agent Framework Integration
:Objective: Integrate the ChatDev framework with smart contracts to simulate multi-agent systems aligned with DAO principles.
 -Tasks:Define clear and achievable goals for AI agents, starting with simple rules.Utilize ChatDev's visualization tools to observe and debug agent behavior.Establish initial agent roles and interactions.Gradually increase complexity in agent behaviors as needed.
3. Integration and Communication Setup
:Objective: Establish a secure and reliable connection between on-chain DAO decisions and off-chain ChatDev simulation using Chainlink oracles.
 -Tasks:Set up Chainlink oracles for data transfer.Test thoroughly to ensure data integrity between oracles and ChatDev.Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track communication events.
4. User Interface Development
:Objective: Develop a minimal and user-friendly interface for users to interact with the DAO and observe basic agent behavior.
-Tasks:Create a basic user interface within ChatDev to receive data from oracles.Prioritize essential functionalities such as member management and voting.
5. Testing and Refinement
:Objective: Iteratively test and refine the system, focusing on improving communication, decision-making, and agent behavior.
-Tasks:Conduct initial testing of individual components.Gather feedback from users and stakeholders to identify improvements.Implement necessary refinements based on feedback.Repeat testing and refinement cycles iteratively.
6. Documentation and GitHub Repository
:Objective: Document the entire development process comprehensively and create a GitHub repository for open collaboration.
-Tasks:Maintain clear and comprehensive documentation for smart contracts, AI agent framework, and integration processes.Create a GitHub repository with clear instructions for deployment and usage.Encourage community involvement and contributions.
7. Additional Considerations
:Objective: Address additional considerations like security, scalability, and exploration of simulation tools.
-Tasks:Prioritize security testing and audits for smart contracts.Explore simulation tools to model agent behavior and system dynamics.Plan for scalability to accommodate larger agent swarms and complex tasks.
